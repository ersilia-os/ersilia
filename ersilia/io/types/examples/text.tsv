Avoid red meat	 sausages and pies; fruit	 vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries	 wholemeal or brown bread; nuts	 pulses	 baked beans; wholemeal pasta	 brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits	 yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken	 grilled or poached fish	 cheese	 eggs; white bread	 pasta	 rice; boiled or mashed potatoes	 water	 fizzy drinks	 fruit squash (not blackcurrant)	 clear soups	 tea or coffee	 shredless marmalade or jam	 ice cream	 custard	 clear jelly	 butter	 margarine. 



The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep	 one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola	 Lucozade	 or ginger ale	 any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.



On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but	 because of warnings about taste	 I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste.

I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom	 anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals	 but not the worst I have ever had.
