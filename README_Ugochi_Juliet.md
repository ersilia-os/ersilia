# Project Description
With just some compound inputs and pretrained AI tools, scientists can now have access to millions of data for research. The Ersilia Model Hub, a [project](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-book/) of the Ersilia Open Source Initiative made this possible. It embeds the experimental data for each compound, plus targets and side-effects profiles, thus making it a more powerful and clinically relevant predictor. You can see the available models can be checked at [Ersilia Model Hub](https://airtable.com/shr9sYjL70nnHOUrP/tblZGe2a2XeBxrEHP)


## Key Features
* GitHub Flavored Markdown
* Models for infectious and neglected diseases 
* Large scale datasets
* Scientific literature
* Full-screen mode
* Work distraction-free
* Windows and Linux ready. 
 

# Getting started
You should follow the **installation instructions** from the [Ersilia Book](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-book/quick-start/installation).

Once Ersilia is installed, you can **browse models** in the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://airtable.com/shrXfZ8pqro0jjcsG/tblZGe2a2XeBxrEHP/viwd5XJVLslkE11Tg).

Select one model. For example `chemprop-antibiotic`. You can **fetch** your model with the Ersilia CLI:
```
ersilia fetch chemprop-antibiotic
```
Then, **serve** your model:
```
ersilia serve chemprop-antibiotic
```
And run the prediction **API**:
```
ersilia api -i my_molecules.csv -o my_predictions.csv
```
Finally, **close** the service when you are done.
```
ersilia close
```

Please see the [Ersilia Book](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-book/) for more examples and detailes explanations.

# How to Contribute
The Ersilia Model Hub is developed and maintained by a small team of Ersilia employees and volunteers, and any contribution is highly valued! 

If you are a developer who wants to help us to improve the tool, have developed a model, a scientist with a cool dataset, or you want us to incorporate a third-party model in the Hub, open an issue with the relevant information and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Clone this repo https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia and create a new branch
2. Make the changes you want 
3. Submit Pull Request with a comprehensive description of the change

The Ersilia Open Source Initiative adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-wiki/code-of-conduct) guidelines.

# Roadmap
We are working to grow the Hub organically and responding to our users' needs. Here a detail of the next features to come, stay tuned!
Outreachy applicants, these are ideas we can work on during your internship.
1. Deployment for Windows System (expected: February 2022)
2. Automated third-party model contributions (expected: March 2022)
3. Possibility to run lite models online (expected: May 2022)
