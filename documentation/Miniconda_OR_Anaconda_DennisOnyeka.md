### Which should you choose?

**Minconda OR Anaconda**

> Note:

 Conda is the package manager (i.e. it displays all the installed packages in the environment.)
Whereas Anaconda and Miniconda are distributions (i.e. they are collection of packages, pre-built and pre-configured, that can be installed and used on a computer system).

**Choose Miniconda:**
• If you do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually.
• If you do not have time or disk space to install over 1,500 packages at once.
• If you want fast access to Python and the conda commands and you wish to sort out the other programs later.
Once you have Miniconda, you can easily install Anaconda into it with this command
“ `conda install anaconda` ”.

**Choose Anaconda:**
• If you are new to conda or Python.
• If you like the convenience of having Python and over 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed at once.
• If you have enough time and disk space--- 4 GB RAM and above.
• If you do not want to individually install each of the packages you want to use.
• If you wish to use a set of packages structured and examined for interoperability and usability.

Whether you use Anaconda  or Miniconda, select the most recent version.
