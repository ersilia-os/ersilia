## Code of Conduct

We aspire to create a welcoming and safe environment for collaboration on this project and ask all contributors to do the same. Help us keep Ersilia open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Where to Start?

The best place to start is by checking our issue tracker. Our issues have the following labels to guide contributors in their work:

| Label            | Description                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Good first issue | A small task suitable to start your contributions to the project|
| Help wanted      | An issue currently not assigned to anyone                       |
| Bug              | Fix something that is not working                               |
| Enhancement      | Add a new feature                                               |
| Documentation    | Issues related to the project's documentation                   |

## How to Contribute

If this is the first time contributing to an Open Source project, read a bit about [How to Contribute to An Open Source Project on Github](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) and [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests). If you land here during the Outreachy contribution period, please look for the appropriate guidelines in our [documentation](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-book/contributors/internships).

## Create a new Issue 🚀

The issue tracking avoids duplications and prevents different contributors working on the same feature separately, so please make sure to create a new issue with the appropriate labels before jumping on coding!

## Contribution Workflow

Once you have identified an issue to tackle, follow the next steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make changes in your fork (or in a branch of your fork)
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a description of the changes made. A good description really helps the community managers. Link the issue the PR is related to as well.
4. PR's have automated tests. If the tests fail, please make the necessary changes. Ersilia maintainers will only work on PRs that pass the tests.
5. Once the PR has been merged, delete your fork of the repository. Our Git-LFS quota also takes into account forks, so having unused forks sitting around is eating up our space in Git LFS. Thanks for taking care of the community.
6. Look for a new issue to work on!

## Other Contributing Suggestions

* Support already existing contributors with comments on the issues they might be tackling
* Create new issues for bug reports or feature enhancements using the appropriate templates (even if the issue is out of scope for you, it might be a good job for another contributor)
* Suggest new models to the Ersilia Model Hub using an issue or via our online [form](https://airtable.com/shrmEcwwxpb21TEVw)
* Documentation-related enhancements are very welcome, please work on them by opening a new issue

## I still have questions

If you need some more guidance, open an issue and get support from the community!
