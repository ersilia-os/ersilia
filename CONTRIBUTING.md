# Contributing
Thank you for contributing to Ersilia's mission and vision!
Ersilia is an open project and everyone is welcome to contribute to it. Please read the following sections to make sure your contribution aligns with Ersilia's guidelines and is an enjoyable experience for all.

## Code of Conduct
We aspire to create a welcoming and safe environment for collaboration on this project and ask all contributors to do the same. Help us keep Ersilia open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Where to Start?
The best place to start is by checking our issue tracker. Our issues have the following labels to guide contributors in their work:
* good first issue: a small task suitable to start your contributions to the project
* help wanted: an issue currently not assigned to anyone
* bug: fix something that is not working
* enhancement: add a new feature
* documentation: issues related to the project's documentation

If this is the first time contributing to an Open Source project, read a bit about [How to Contribute to An Open Source Project on Github](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) and [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)
 
## Create a new issue 🚀

The issue tracking avoids duplications and prevents different contributors working on the same feature separately, so please make sure to create a new issue with the appropriate labels before jumping on coding!

## Contribution workflow
Once you have identified an issue to tackle, follow the next steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make changes in your fork (or in a branch of your fork)
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a description of the changes made. A good description really helps the community managers
4. Make any required changes to the PR
5. Once the PR has been merged, you can continue working on a new issue or delete the fork!

## Other contributing suggestions
* Support already existing contributors with comments on the issues they might be tackling
* Create new issues for bug reports or feature enhancements using the appropriate templates (even if the issue is out of scope for you, it might be a good job for another contributor)
* Suggest new models to the Ersilia Model Hub using an issue or via our online [form](https://ersilia.io/request-model)
* Documentation-related enhancements are very welcome, please work on them by opening a new issue

## I still have questions
If you need some more guidance, open an issue and get support from the community!
