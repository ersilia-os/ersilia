# Ersilia
At the World Health Organization (WHO), in the 2013 report, is where the inspiration came from and stirred three scientists. From there, the Ersilia Open Source Initiative (EOSI) is created. 
The goal is to bring scientific development to the low and middle-low income countries, as this is important for the progress of this organization. 
For this, some points have been filtered, arriving at priorities that will direct Ersilia in the next three years, which are:

- Drug discovery for infectious and neglected tropical diseases;
- Implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods.
