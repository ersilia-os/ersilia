# Strategic plan (2021 ~ 2023)
At the World Health Organization (WHO), in the 2013 report, is where the inspiration came from and stirred three scientists. From there, the Ersilia Open Source Initiative (EOSI) is created. 
The goal is to bring scientific development to the low and middle-low income countries, as this is important for the progress of this organization. 
For this, some points have been filtered, arriving at priorities that will direct Ersilia in the next three years, which are:

- Drug discovery for infectious and neglected tropical diseases;
- Implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods.

## Mission, vision and values
Now, about the mission, which is to strengthen research capabilities against diseases. Now,  about the vision, which is to bring those in need equal access to health care. Last but not least, we have values that are based on openness, innovation, empowerment, inclusion and diversity, integrity and accountability.

## The five goals
About the strategic plan, it has five objectives. 

- The first is to facilitate the access of AI/ML technologies to all scientists: one of the difficulties encountered among scientists and researchers is the implementation of AI/ML methods in daily research. With this in mind, there is the launching of the Ersilia Model Hub, which is a functional package that does not require powerful machines to run and query.

- The second, to achieve sustainability for the Ersilia Model Hub: in this second goal, it is a method without the need to code, but with the need to disseminate this information and thus focus on growth.

- The third is to implement AI/ML routines in LMIC labs:
here is already mentioned the idea of partnering with key researchers in the field, to support outstanding scientists in their respective countries

- The fourth is increasing the acceptance and popularity of computational research: in this fourth goal, it happens beyond the previous ones, because we enter in terms of approval. as in many situations, here we have two sides. the side that believes in the effectiveness and power of working with data and on the other side, those who do not believe and do not support. This ends up becoming a concern, but for this it is necessary to find the middle ground.

- And the fifth is to improve the governance and organization chart of EOSI: finally, it is seen that in order for the above items to work, there is also a need for people who are committed to the cause, ready to listen and give their opinion, and who cooperate with the growth of this project that is so important for those who are invisible.
