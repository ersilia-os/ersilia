# Writing Style

Consistency creates clarity in communication.

If you find yourself correcting for consistency, please propose additional style guidelines via pull request to this document. Feel free to add references to good sources for content guidelines at the bottom of this guide.

## Additional formatting 

- Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon.

- Paragraphs do not start with leading indent

- Wrap lines at 80 characters, except where it would break a link. No need to reformat the whole paragraph to make it perfect -- fewer diffs are easier for reviewers.

## File and directory naming conventions

- Every directory should have a README.md with useful introductory text.

- All other file and directory names should be all lower case with dashes to separate words.
